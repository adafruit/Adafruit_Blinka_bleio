       Discovery of other devices happens during a scanning process that listens for small packets
       of information, known as advertisements, that are broadcast unencrypted. The advertising
       packets have two different uses. The first is to broadcast a small piece of data to anyone
       who cares and and nothing more. These are known as Beacons. The second class of advertisement
       is to promote additional functionality available after the devices establish a connection.
       For example, a BLE keyboard may advertise that it can provide key information, but not what
       the key info is.

       The built-in BLE adapter can do both parts of this process: it can scan for other device
       advertisements and it can advertise its own data. Furthermore, Adapters can accept incoming
       connections and also initiate connections."""
